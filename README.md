==========


**Pullcord** will be a reverse proxy for cloud-based web apps that will allow the servers the web apps run on to be turned off when not in use. Pullcord should be nimble enough to run on the smallest cloud servers available, but it will be able to quickly spin up much larger servers running much bulkier web apps. Once traffic to these larger servers has stopped for a specified period of time, these other servers will be spun back down. Pullcord will be able to perform these duties for multiple web apps simultaneously, so there is no need to have more than one Pullcord server, and there is no need to consolidate multiple web apps onto a single server (in fact, Pullcord will likely work better if each web app is on its own server, as it will still be possible to spin up multiple servers if there are dependencies between the web apps).
